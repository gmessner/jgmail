Author: Gregory M. Messner <gmessner@messners.com>
Version: 2.1.0


JgMail is a Java class package which can be used to send and receive mail
to and from mail servers. It implements the POP3 protocol for retrieving mail
and the SMTP protocol to send mail. Support is provided for attaching files 
when sending mail and for decoding attached files when receiving mail. JgMail
is simple to use. Sending and receiving mail can be accomplished in as little
as 4 lines of code.


Installing
----------
1) Unzip the JgMail archive (which you've probably already done if you
are reading this).

2) Add the jgmail.jar file to your CLASSPATH.

3) Run the samples that can be found in the build/samples/ directory. These will give 
you a basic idea on how to use JgMail.

4) For more information on JgMail see the javadoc documentation that can
be found in the build/docs/ directory. All source is included and can be used as
an additional reference.
